Go Reddit
---------

This is a simple golang program which prints out the title and score of submissions to th Python subreddit. This project was done for fossasia.

The program takes in one input. It is the name of the subreddit which you want to parse. It can be passed like this:

```
go run task.go -subreddit python
```

Thanks!
